International Students â Masters Graduate Stream
Notice: Deadline for Submitting Online Applications through the OINP e-Filing Portal
In order to be responsive to unprecedented application-volume demand on the system, the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) has revised the deadline from seven to 14 calendar days to submit applications through the e-Filing Portal for the following streams:
International Masters Graduate Stream
International PhD Graduate Stream
Ontarioâs Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream
Once you successfully register a profile under any of the above streams through the OINP e Filing Portal, you now have 14 calendar days to complete your application. âWe are making every effort to ensure we have the technical capacity to meet volume demands and we will continue to monitor the system 24 hours a day, to address any issues.
The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) offers an opportunity for international students with a Masterâs degree obtained in Ontario to live and work permanently in Ontario.
Applicants applying to the Masters Graduate Stream can apply without a job offer.
Please see the Application Guide: International Students â Masters Graduate Stream for more details.
