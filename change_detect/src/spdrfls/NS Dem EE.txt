Nova Scotia Demand: Express Entry
The Nova Scotia Demand: Express Entry stream selects highly skilled individuals who wish to live in Nova Scotia permanently. Applicants must have a good chance of quickly finding a job in Nova Scotia’s labour market.
The Nova Scotia Office of Immigration reserves the right to consider only certain types of occupations for nomination, depending on current labour market needs.
Applications will only be accepted online.
Category A (for applicants with a job offer) will remain open.
Category B (for applicants with experience in an opportunity occupation) is expected to open and close over the next year. Controlling intake will allow us to process applications more efficiently. 
Please continue to check this webpage for updates. 
Category B is now closed.
