      About us    
The Office of Immigration is the operating name of the crown corporation Island Investment Development Inc. (IIDI) which is a part of the Department of Economic Development and Tourism. The Office of Immigration is responsible for administering the Provincial Nominee Program through an agreement with the federal government.
The Prince Edward Island Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) nominates individuals to the federal government for permanent residency. Individuals are chosen based on their ability to economically establish and their intent to live and work in PEI. Current key needs that are being met by the PEI PNP are filling gaps in our labour market and attracting entrepreneurs.
