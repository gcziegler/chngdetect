Compulsory and Optional Trades Criteria 
These criteria apply to all supervisors, foremen and tradespeople working in a compulsory or optional trade (PDF) in Alberta.
The criteria for the Compulsory and Optional Trades Category include but are not limited to:
You must intend to and be able to live and work permanently in Alberta. 
You must have:
            
a valid Alberta Qualification Certificate in a compulsory or optional trade (PDF), or 
a valid Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training (AIT) Recognized Trade Certificate in a compulsory or optional trade (PDF)
                If you do not have an Alberta Qualification Certificate or an AIT Recognized Trade Certificate when you apply to the AINP, your application will be declined. The AINP will verify that your trade certificate is valid and qualifies. 
You must be residing in Alberta at the time of application and show that you have a valid work permit from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to work in Alberta in the trade in which you are certified. 
You must show, at the time of application, that you are either currently working in your trade for an Alberta Employer or have previously worked in your trade with an Alberta Employer for a minimum of six months in the past two years. 
If you are working as a Parts Technician (see AIT definitions for this occupation here and here), you are working in a NOC C (semi-skilled) level occupation. You are required to meet language requirements for semi-skilled occupations. The minimum language scores you must meet are set out on the Semi-Skilled Worker Category criteria page. There are three accepted language tests you can choose from. Your test result cannot be more than two years old at the time you submit your AINP application. 
If you meet these criteria, make sure you review the How to Apply section before you submit your application. If your application does not meet AINP criteria, it will be declined. If your application is not complete, it will be returned to you and it will not be processed.
Meeting the criteria listed above does not guarantee a nomination or permanent residence.
Who is not eligible?
In addition to individuals who are not working in an optional or compulsory trade in Alberta (PDF), individuals in the following circumstances are not eligible under the Strategic Recruitment Stream:
Refugee claimants, or individuals involved in a federal appeal or removal process. It is not the mandate of the AINP to intervene in the federal refugee claim, appeal or removal process. 
Live-in Caregivers currently living in Canada 
Temporary Foreign Workers working and residing in a province other than Alberta 
International students studying in Canada, including students doing co-op work placements or internships as part of their study program.
Note: Review AINP terms and conditions before applying.
