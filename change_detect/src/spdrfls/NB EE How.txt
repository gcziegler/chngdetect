New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program (NBPNP)
Government of New Brunswick
NB Express Entry
Please visit the Eligibility Requirements to Submit an EOI.  Please note that New Brunswick is only accepting Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for the PNP Express Entry Labour Market Stream from individuals currently employed in New Brunswick. Please continue to monitor this page for any updates.
Express Entry is a new online application management system introduced by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada in January 2015. Express Entry will change Canadaâs immigration system into one that is faster and more responsive to economic and labour market needs.
The New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program (NBPNP) has developed and launched its Express Entry Labour Market Stream (EELMS). This stream allows the NBPNP to use CICâs Express Entry system to meet New Brunswickâs specific labour market and demographic needs.
    
NBPNP Express Entry Steps to Become a Permanent Resident:
Step 1
Review EELMS requirements to determine if you are eligible.
The eligibility requirements and selection factors are in our Guide on pages 7-10 on our website.
Step 2
Determine if you are eligible to submit your expression of interest (EOS) to the NBPNP EELMS.
If you meet the above Guide's requirements, review the Eleigibility Requirements to Submit an EOI page on our website.
Step 3
Send you EOI to the NBPNP Express Entry mailbox at entree.express.entry@gnb.ca, provided you are eligible.
EOIs are accepted continuously.
Step 4
Submit a full EELMS application to the NBPNP within 60 calendar days, after receiving your invitation to apply.
Step 5
Accept your nomination electronically through your MyCIC Account.
You have 30 days to accept the NBPNP nomination once your application is successful, and you have been nominated.
Before applying to the NBPNP EELMS, you must follow two steps. First, please read the NBPNP EELMS Guide to make sure you fulfill the eligibility requirements and meet the selection factors of the program (p. 7-14).
If you have determined that you meet the requirements of the Program, your next step is to determine if you are eligible to submit an expression of the interest (EOI) to the NBPNP EELMS. Please review the Eligibility Requirements to Submit an EOI section to see if you are eligible. Once you have established both Program and EOI eligibility, complete the Expression of Interest (EOI) form and email it to entree.express.entry@gnb.ca, along with your most recent CV. Upon receiving your information, NBPNP staff will evaluate your submission and invite the most suitable candidates to apply to the EELMS.
To effectively complete the EOI form, candidates must have completed a recognized language exam (IELTS, CELPIP or TEF) as well as a mandatory educational credential assessment (ECA), for education obtained outside of Canada, and provide a history of their work experience. If you are submitting an EOI and do not have an arranged employment offer, you must have access to the appropriate amount of settlement funds. You will also have to identify the Canadian National Occupational Classification (NOC) code used to describe your primary occupation. If you have more questions about NBPNP EELMS, please see our FAQ page.
Please visit our website often as the dates we accept EOI forms may change, depending on volume and priorities. The EELMS may be paused occasionally to ensure we can process applications and respect our nomination allocation. Therefore, only a portion of potential candidates will be invited to apply. Please keep in mind that meeting the minimum Program requirements does not ensure you get an invitation to apply.
Once the above steps have been completed, nominated individuals may receive an invitation to apply for permanent residency from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). For more details on this process, please visit the CIC Express Entry website.
