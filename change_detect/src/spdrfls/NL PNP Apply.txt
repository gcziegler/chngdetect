How do I Apply?
Applying to the NLPNP is a simple process. First, potential applicants must determine which of the categories they belong to - Skilled Worker, Express Entry Skilled Worker, or International Graduate. Following this, the potential applicant will download and complete all required provincial and federal forms for their category and gather the required supporting documentation (eg. Birth Certificates, Diplomas, Passports etc). Once this is complete, the candidate will send in all forms and documentation to the Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism. Below is a brief overview of the categories.
