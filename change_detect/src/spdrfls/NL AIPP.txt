Frequently Asked Questions
Newfoundland and Labrador-Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program for Employers
The Atlantic Immigration Pilot (AIPP) is a three-year employer driven immigration program aimed at addressing skills gaps and labour market needs in the four Atlantic Provinces by assisting employers in attracting and retaining skilled immigrants. 
In early March 2017, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada began accepting permanent resident applications targeting international students, intermediate-skilled workers and high-skilled workers. 
Newfoundland and Labrador is working closely with the other Atlantic Provinces and the Federal Government to ensure the successful development and delivery of the AIPP. The Pilot will facilitate the entry of an additional 2,000 principal applicants and their family members annually into Atlantic Canada from 2017 to 2019, of which up to 442 applications have been allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador. 
To participate, employers must meet certain requirements, including a commitment to support the newcomer and their family as they integrate into their new life in Atlantic Canada.
