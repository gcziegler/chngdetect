Provincial nominees
Most provinces and territories in Canada can nominate  immigrants through the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). These immigrants must have  the skills, education and work experience to contribute to the economy of that  province or territory, and must want to live there. 
 Each province and territoryFootnote * has its own “streams”  (immigration programs that target certain groups) and criteria for their PNP. For  example, in a program stream, provinces and territories may target students,  business people, skilled workers or semi-skilled workers.
 Since January 1, 2015, many provinces and territories have  launched new Express Entry streams. Check their websites to learn more about which  streams they offer.
Footnotes
Footnote *
The province of Quebec does not have a PNP. See their immigration website to learn more about their programs.

1. Determine  your eligibility
Each province and territory’s streams, eligibility requirements  and nomination guidelines for their PNP can change without notice. Check the websites of the provinces or territories for  the most up-to-date information.
 If  you are nominated under a non-Express Entry stream:
you will have to apply  through the paper-based process, and
if the province or  territory finds you eligible and nominates you, you will send an application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).
If you  are nominated under a province or territory’s Express Entry stream, you must: 
meet their  requirements, and 
meet the minimum criteria  for Express Entry
      
this includes meeting the requirements of at least one of the immigration programs it covers. 
You can use our online tool, Come to Canada, to see if you are eligible. If you are invited to  apply for permanent residence, you will submit an online application to IRCC. 
 Find out more about eligibility for the PNP. Â 
2. Apply
To apply for the PNP you  must: 
apply to a province  or territory for a nomination,
be nominated by that  province or territory, then
apply to IRCC to  become a permanent resident.
Under a PNP Express  Entry stream, you will need to complete an Express Entry profile and show that  you meet the minimum criteria for Express Entry. 
 Learn more about applying to the PNP. 
3. Check  processing times
Find out how long it  will take IRCC to process your application under the paper-based process (non-Express Entry  streams).
 If you apply through  Express Entry (Express Entry streams), most complete applications for permanent  residence will be processed in six months or less. Since Express Entry is a new  system, average processing times are not yet available.
