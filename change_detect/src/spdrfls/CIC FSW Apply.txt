Express Entry 
Apply â Skilled immigrants (Express Entry)
Learn how to apply for permanent residence after you are invited to apply.
Your Express Entry invitation to apply is valid for 90 days.
1. Fill out the online form
Follow these steps:
sign in to your account
click the link to apply for permanent residence under Express Entry
        
all of your answers must be complete and true
you must fill out all the mandatory fields in the form or you won’t be able to submit your application
you can save your information on the form and go back as often as you need to
check the personalized Document Checklist the system generates when you complete your application. It shows all the supporting documents you need to upload.
2. Get all the documents you need
Get all the documents listed on your personalized Document Checklist. Make electronic copies of your supporting documents using a scanner or camera. Make sure you use one of the formats we accept. Once you have your documents ready, upload them.
Documents most people need to include:
language test results
provincial nominations (if you have one)
valid written    job offers from an employer in Canada (if you have one)
proof that you have enough money to support yourself and your family members in Canada, if any are coming with you (in some cases)
valid passports (we don’t accept expired passports or other travel documents)
Educational    Credential Assessment reports (if you included the results in    your Express Entry profile)
medical exams
police certificates (if you have more than one police certificate you need to combine your documents)
any other documents on the Document Checklist
We need copies of these documents to support the information in your Express Entry profile.
Expiring passports
If your passport expires within six months from the day you apply, you should renew it. Then, update your passport information in your application. This will make sure it is valid when we process your application.
Educational Credential Assessments
You need an Educational Credential Assessment if you:
are being invited to apply under the Federal Skilled Worker Program (it will tell you this on your invitation letter) and you were educated outside Canada, or
were awarded points for your foreign education (no matter which program you were invited to apply under)
Medical exams 
You must have a medical exam before you apply. Your family members must also have one, even if they aren’t coming with you.
We won’t approve your permanent resident application if your health:
is a danger to Canada’s public health or safety
would cause too much demand on health or social services in Canada
When the panel physician completes the medical exam, they will give you an:
information printout sheet 
IMM 1017B Upfront Medical Report form
You must provide a copy of these documents when you apply online.
Don’t complete your medical exam until you get your invitation to apply. The results of your exam must be valid at the time you submit your application for permanent residence. For this reason, it is a good idea to complete the exam as close as possible to the date you submit your online application.
Police certificates 
To immigrate to Canada, you and any family members 18 and older must include their police certificates as part of the application for permanent residence.
If you have a criminal record, you may not be allowed to enter or stay in Canada. People who pose a risk to Canada’s security are also not allowed to come to Canada.
3. Pay your fees
When applying for permanent residence you will have to pay:
a) The processing fee for you and your family members
When you apply, you need to pay a processing fee for everyone who will come to Canada with you on your application.
You must pay the fees through your online account using a debit or credit card.
We won’t refund the processing fee once we have begun processing your application.
If your application isn’t complete, we will tell you and refund your processing fee.
b) The Right of Permanent Residence fee
The right of permanent residence fee is $490.00 per person. There is no fee for dependent children.
You will need to pay this fee:
if we approve your application 
before we issue you any permanent resident documents
You may pay this fee early, when you submit your application, as it may speed up the application process.
We will refund this fee if:
you withdraw your application 
your application is refused
c) Other fees
You may have to pay fees to third parties for:
language testing
Educational Credential Assessments
medical exams
police checks/clearances and certificates
document translations
4. Submit your complete application
Before you send us your application, make sure you:
fill out all mandatory form fields
pay your fees
include clear scans of all supporting documents
The system won’t let you submit the application unless you include all required documents. Use the Document Checklist to make sure you don’t forget anything.
Once you submit your application, we will process it and check that:
all the information you gave us is true 
you’re:
        
eligible to immigrate 
admissible to Canada
If we find you eligible, we will tell you what to do next.
