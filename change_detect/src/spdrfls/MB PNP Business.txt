MPNP for Business
Open for Business and Farming Through Immigration
With a population of 1.259 million and with diverse skills and multicultural backgrounds, Manitoba is the ideal size and place to start or purchase a business or farm (See Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative), and to raise a family.
Manitoba invites you to explore the business-friendly atmosphere and abundant opportunities that await you in the province. We have a history of welcoming newcomers and fully recognize the importance of business and farm immigrants to our province’s economic and demographic development. We encourage you to take advantage of an extensive network of services available to newcomers.
The Province of Manitoba and Government of Canada share responsibilities regarding business people immigrating to Canada through the Provincial Nominee Program for Business.
The Provincial Nominee Program for Business allows Manitoba to recruit and nominate qualified business people from around the world who have the intent and ability to move to Manitoba and establish, purchase a business or become partners in an existing business.
The Provincial Nominee Program for Business accelerates the immigration process by providing a Nomination Certificate to you which allows for faster processing by the Government of Canada of your immigration application. The Province of Manitoba is committed to help you and your family settle successfully, identify business opportunities and establish your business or farm in the province.
For more information on Manitoba’s business advantages, visit Strategic Business Advantages, or Investing in Manitoba, where you will find an extensive Manitoba Business Facts section.
Support services for applicants who have landed in Manitoba are provided by the Business Settlement Office of Entrepreneurship Manitoba.
