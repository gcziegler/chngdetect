Provincial nominees
Apply (paper-based process) â Provincial nominees
Follow these steps to  apply for the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) through the paper-based application  process. (Or, find out how to apply electronically through Express Entry.) 
1. Get a provincial nomination certificate
Visit the website for the province or territory where you want to  live to find out how to get a nomination certificate.
 Follow the instructions on the province or territory’s  website and apply for one of their PNP streams. (Do not submit an application  for an Express Entry PNP stream, unless you wish to apply through that process.) 
 The province or territory will review your  application. If you meet their criteria, they will issue you a nomination  certificate. You must submit a copy of the nomination certificate when you  apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for permanent residence.
2. Fill out your application
Once you have been nominated by a province or  territory, you can submit an application for permanent residence.
 The application package includes the  instruction guide and all the forms you need to fill out after a province or  territory has nominated you. The guide will help you fill out the forms  properly.
 You must: 
Fill out the forms on your computer. When you are done:
      
Validate the Generic Application Form for Canada [IMM 0008] (PDF, 479.00 KB) online. Click        the “validate” button on the top or bottom of the form. If there are any fields you still need to fill out, they will be marked in red.
Print the validated application form, including the barcode page(s). (This page will come up after you validate the form.)
Sign and date the form where asked.
Include all the pages of the application form, including the barcode page(s), with your application.
Print the other forms, and sign and date them where asked. 
Verify that your answers are complete and true.
Fill out all the forms listed in the application package. Use the Document Checklist (PDF, 728.82 KB) to make sure you do not miss anything.
Find out more about the barcode form.
3. Pay your application fees
You will have to pay:
a) The processing fee for you and your family members who  will come to Canada
You must pay a separate fee for each family member who is  included on your application and will be joining you in Canada. Check the fee list to see how much it will be.
If your application is complete, we’ll let you know and  we’ll send your application to one of our offices for processing. Once we start  processing your application, we cannot refund your processing fee. Make sure  you’re eligible before you apply.
b) The Right of Permanent Residence Fee
If we approve your application, you must pay this fee before  you can become a permanent resident.
We will refund this fee if:
you cancel your application, 
we do not approve your application or 
you decide not to come to Canada. 
If your spouse or common law partner will be joining you  in Canada you’ll need to pay a separate right of permanent residence fee before  they can become a permanent resident.
