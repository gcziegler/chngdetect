This page outlines changes and updates related to the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program.
AINP News
April 24, 2017
AINP applicants must maintain a valid work permit throughout the AINP application and assessment process. Only applicants under the Strategic Recruitment Stream Engineering Occupations Category are exempt from this requirement. 
The Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) is receiving a growing number of applications where the applicant’s work permit expires shortly after the date the application was received. Before submitting your application to the AINP, it is strongly encouraged that you review the AINP processing and inventory webpage for current application volumes and processing dates for the AINP Category or Industry under which you are applying. The more time you allow between the date your application is received by the AINP and the date your work permit expires, the more likely it is that the AINP may get to assessing your application before your work permit expires.
May 12, 2016
If you have been affected by the wildfires in the Fort McMurray area, we ask you to contact the AINP to update your contact information.
If you have an application currently in the queue waiting to be assessed and you are unemployed due to the wildfire, your application will be put on hold up to a maximum of one year from the date of evacuation to give you time to maintain your eligibility. Once you inform us that you have found new or alternate employment in an occupation eligible under the AINP, your application will be returned to its original spot in the queue for processing. Keep in mind that your new employer must also meet eligibility criteria.
If you have already received a nomination, your nomination will be maintained and you will be given an opportunity to find new or alternate employment (in an occupation eligible under the AINP and the new employer must also meet eligibility criteria). Be sure to keep the AINP informed of your employment status. If you are actively looking for employment, your nomination will be maintained.
For additional questions, please contact us by email at immigration.info@gov.ab.ca or by phone: 
Monday to Friday: 8:15 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mountain Time 
Our hours of operation have changed to be available starting at 8:15 a.m. and will continue until further notice 
Toll-free: 1-877-427-6419 from anywhere in Alberta 
Telephone: 780-427-6419 from outside Alberta
For wildfire related information, you can call 310-4455.
January 27, 2016
Effective immediately, the temporary pause on application intake has ended and the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) is now accepting new applications under all AINP streams and categories. During the pause, the AINP was successful in reducing the application queue by almost half, with fewer than 5,000 applications remaining to be processed.
Current applicants to the AINP with existing applications will remain in the queue awaiting assessment. Please visit the AINP processing and inventory page for regular updates on application processing and inventory status.
In order to manage the volume of applications going forward, we may stop accepting new applications in the future if the program is oversubscribed. We will monitor the program closely and look for opportunities to improve the program as necessary in the future. Any updates to the program will be posted on this website.
Applications postmarked before January 27, 2016 will be returned. 
August 27, 2015
Effective immediately, the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) will not be accepting new applications under any AINP Streams or Categories until January 27, 2016. This temporary pause will help the AINP assess existing applications in the queue and prevent the queue from growing further. The pause will also provide an opportunity to make improvements to the program.
Complete applications postmarked on or before August 27, 2015, will be accepted for processing. AINP staff will continue to assess applications already in the queue. Visit the AINP processing and inventory page for regular updates on application processing and inventory status.
Applications postmarked after August 27, 2015, will be returned.

April 24, 2015
As of May 1, 2015, the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) will no longer accept applications or documents hand delivered to the AINP office. This measure is required to ensure the security of your documents and to allow the AINP to focus on program delivery.
It is strongly encouraged that you send your application or documents to the AINP via registered mail or courier. Sending your AINP application or documents by registered mail or courier helps ensure that your documents receive priority delivery and that your documents can be traced.
The AINP cannot confirm receipt of an application or additional information. Do not send any additional documents or information to the AINP until you receive a file number.
February 20, 2015
NOTICE – EMAIL SCAM ALERT
The Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) is warning individuals of fraudulent emails in which the individual identifies themselves as an AINP representative to collect personal information with a Gmail account. 
The Alberta Government does not use email accounts such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. The official email will always come from a @gov.ab.ca account. 
Anyone who receives a suspicious email should contact their local police and report the incident to the Immigrate to Alberta Information Service at 1-877-427-6419 (toll-free) or by email at immigration.info@gov.ab.ca. 
February 6, 2015
Many Alberta provincial nominees are asking if they can use their Alberta nomination for Express Entry. An AINP certificate of nomination cannot be used for Express Entry. If you have created an Express Entry profile, do not indicate that you are an Alberta Provincial Nominee.
January 23, 2015
Effective immediately, the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) has reduced the number of months a semi-skilled worker in the Food and Beverage Processing Industry needs to be employed in Alberta to qualify to apply to the AINP. Candidates who work in one of the eligible food and beverage processing occupations are now eligible to apply after being employed in Alberta for a minimum of three months.
Review the Semi-Skilled Worker criteria for complete details.
December 8, 2014
The Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) has issued all 5,500 certificates for the year 2014. Further certificates will not be issued until January 2015. See the related News Release for more information.
October 17, 2014
The size of the AINP is limited by the federal government, and Alberta can nominate 5,500 people in the year 2014. So far, we have issued more than 4,000 nominations.
As you can imagine, given the number of jobs being created in our strong economy, the number of temporary foreign workers in the province and recent federal immigration changes, the program is very popular. More than 10,000 people are hoping to earn a nomination either this year, next year, or even the year after that.
AINP has traditionally operated on a first-come-first-served basis. For the rest of 2014, the remaining nomination certificates will be issued based on labour market information and industry general averages in recent years. This approach is fair because it means that more industries will be supported by the program. However, it does mean that some applications in sectors which have already received high levels of support will not be processed this year.

August 27, 2014
Effective September 1, 2014, the minimum wage will increase for employees in Alberta, including Temporary Foreign Workers. See the following News Release for further information.
July 28, 2014
Effective August 1, 2014, there are new rules for dependent children. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has changed the definition of a dependent child. The new definition will apply to all federal and provincial immigration applications, including Provincial Nominees. 
As of August 1, 2014, to be eligible as a dependent child, the child must be: 
Under the age of 19 and not married or in a common-law relationship, or 
19 years of age or older and has depended substantially on the financial support of the parent since before the age of 19 and is unable to be financially self-supporting due to a physical or mental condition. 
Complete applications received by the AINP before August 1, 2014 will be assessed under the previous definition of dependent child as long as your child still meets the previous definition at the time your permanent residence application is received by IRCC. Your child’s age will be “locked in” on the date that IRCC receives your complete permanent residence application.
Applications received by the AINP on August 1, 2014 or later will be subject to the new definition of dependent child. Your child’s age will be “locked in” on the date the AINP receives your application.
September 27, 2013
The AINP has made an important change to the eligibility criteria of the Strategic Recruitment Stream, Post-Graduate Worker Category. Effective immediately, only applicants who have completed an eligible program of study in Alberta may apply under this category. Applicants who have completed an eligible program of study outside of Alberta still have the option to apply with an Alberta employer under the Employer-Driven Stream, International Graduate Category. International graduates may also be eligible to apply under other AINP categories.
See the Post-Graduate Worker Category page for details.
September 13, 2013
Several changes have been made to the AINP; they are outlined briefly below. Please click on the respective links for more details.
Foodservices Industry Pilot Project – Additional Allocations
For a limited time (until November 28, 2013), all employers are eligible to apply to nominate up to 20% of their total workforce per restaurant location.
See the Semi-Skilled Worker Category page for details.
Strategic Recruitment Stream – New Post-Graduate Worker Category
International graduates can now apply without needing an employer-supported application. You must be currently working in Alberta, have a current and valid post-graduation work permit, and your occupation must be an eligible NOC 0, A, B or C skill level, among other requirements.
See the Post-Graduate Worker Category page for details.

See the Alberta Work Experience Category page for details.
Employer Driven Stream
Criteria has been streamlined for:
International Graduates 
Managers/Supervisors in the Service, Retail and Foodservice industries 
Plasterers, Drywallers and Upholsterers 
See the International Graduate Category page and Skilled Worker Category page for details.
June 20, 2013
Effective immediately, the AINP has opened a new category under the Strategic Recruitment Stream (SRS) to help foreign workers with the skills needed in Alberta to stay permanently and keep our economy growing. The Alberta Work Experience Category enables eligible workers with at least two years of Alberta work experience in key in-demand occupations to apply to nominate themselves for permanent residence. This new category is taking applications until November 28, 2013.
See the Alberta Work Experience Category information for full details.
May 31, 2013
Semi-Skilled Worker Category: Manufacturing Industry
Effective immediately, the AINP has permanently reduced the number of years of work experience a semi-skilled worker in the Manufacturing Industry needs to qualify to apply to the AINP. Candidates who work in one of the eligible manufacturing occupations are now eligible to apply if they have two years of work experience in a job similar to their Alberta employer’s type of business; at least one year of the work experience must have been obtained in Canada.
Visit the Semi-Skilled Worker criteria page for complete details.
Semi-Skilled Worker Category: Hotel and Lodging Industry
Effective immediately, the AINP has put in place a short-term initiative to help Alberta Employers in the hotel and lodging industry meet their labour needs. The AINP’s 2013 Hotel and Lodging Additional Allocation Initiative temporarily removes the 2013 calendar year allocation limit per property for Front Desk Clerks/Agents, Food and Beverage Servers, and Room Attendants.
Alberta Employers may apply to nominate as many eligible Candidates as they need in any of the three eligible occupations, regardless of how many allocations the employer has used, or not used, to date in 2013. There is no limit on the number of eligible Candidate applications an Alberta Employer may submit during this initiative.
Deadline for the applications is on or before November 28, 2013 (postmarked or delivered in person to the AINP office). Visit the Semi-Skilled Worker criteria page for complete details.
The 2013 allocation system in place before this initiative will apply to applications postmarked or delivered in person after November 28, 2013.
May 17, 2013
Effective immediately, the AINP has implemented a short-term initiative to assist Alberta Employers in the trucking industry to meet their labour needs. Under the 2013 Heavy Haul Initiative, the existing trucking industry category will be temporarily expanded to include heavy haul drivers servicing all industries in Alberta. Long-haul drivers continue to be eligible under this initiative.
To be eligible, heavy haul drivers must, in addition to meeting other criteria,
have an Alberta Class 1 driver’s licence, and 
operate a tractor-trailer unit with a minimum of 5 axles. 
There is no limit on the number of eligible Candidate applications an Alberta Employer may submit during this initiative. Applications must be postmarked or delivered in person on or before November 28, 2013 to be considered for this initiative. Visit the Semi-Skilled Worker criteria page for full details.
All applications postmarked or delivered in person after November 28, 2013 must meet the criteria of the AINP Long-Haul Trucking Industry category and will be subject to the 2013 Long-Haul Trucking Industry allocation system in place before this initiative.
April 30, 2013
To align with changes to Canada’s immigration system, both the Family Stream and U.S. Visa Holder categories of the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) have now been permanently closed. These categories were suspended in 2010 to allow the program to focus on nominating temporary foreign workers for permanent residency who are already here working and addressing immediate labour needs.
Final decisions have been made on all U.S. Visa Holder category applications received prior to the suspension and applicants have been informed. Only a few Family Stream applications remain in the final stage of assessment; these applicants have been notified that a decision on their application is imminent. Reference information related to these categories can be found in the Family Stream and U.S. Visa Holder sections of the AINP website.
Information on the permanent closure of these categories is available through the Alberta Immigration Help Centre. For individuals interested in family reunification, the federal government has a Family Sponsorship Class.
The AINP is an important program will continue to play an integral role in supporting our province’s economic growth.

In addition to holders of Alberta Qualification Certificates, holders of an Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training (AIT) Recognized Trade Certificate, which includes those holding a trade certificate with an Interprovincial Red Seal, are now eligible to apply.

The Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) made changes to its Employer Compliance Declaration form for Restaurant and Foodservices Industry based on feedback from stakeholders.
What do these changes mean to you as an Alberta Employer in the Restaurant and Foodservices Industry? 
If you have not yet submitted an application to the AINP, when you submit your application, you must use the updated Employer Compliance Declaration Form. 
If a previous application you submitted was declined on the basis of misrepresentation for not declaring a citation, violation or breach, you may send a new and complete application to the AINP immediately, using the new form, regardless of any statement from the AINP barring you from applying for a period of one year. 
If a previous application you submitted is in progress, and no decision has yet been reached by the AINP, you must complete the new form, and send it to the AINP immediately by mail, quoting your file number on a cover sheet and/or the form. 
If a previous application you submitted was declined for reasons other than misrepresentation on the former Employer Compliance Declaration form, you are unable to reapply to the AINP for the occupation and/or candidate you had requested. 
If a previous application you submitted was approved, you do not have to submit any information to the AINP regarding that particular/specific application, regardless of the form(s) that was used. 
The Employer Compliance Declaration form is available for download from our website on our application forms page. Employers and Candidates must meet all other eligibility criteria in order to apply to the AINP.
If you have questions about the Employer Compliance Declaration form, call the applicable authority indicated on the form or call the Immigrate to Alberta Information Service.

Application Forms
The Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) updated some of its forms.
Please note that if a third party/representative is being used in the application process, Use of a Representative forms are now separate from the general application forms, and must be attached as needed. When reading and signing the declaration pages, the appropriate individual is referred to the applicable form, only if he or she is using the services of a third party/representative in connection with the application.
Applicants are expected to make every reasonable effort in using the new forms when applying to the AINP, and the AINP reserves the right to require that the most recent versions of the forms be completed upon reviewing a submission.
