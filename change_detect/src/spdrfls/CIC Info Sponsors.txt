Controlling  behaviour that limits your freedom, such as:
Withholding your  passport, identification or other important documents 
Keeping you in your  home and not allowing you to leave
Constantly questioning  and monitoring your internet and phone use
Not allowing you to  see your family and friends
Forced  marriage
Forced  marriage is when consent is not freely given by at least one of  the parties to the marriage.
