Please ensure that you visit the ESDC website Wage Report for Yukon for current and revised wage information before submitting your application to the Yukon Nominee Program (YNP).
About the Yukon Nominee Program
The Yukon Nominee Program (YNP) is run by the Yukon Government in partnership with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) under the âAgreement for Canada-Yukon Cooperation on Immigration.â 
This partnership allows Yukon to nominate applicants who qualify to the federal government for permanent residency. 
The YNP streams for Skilled Workers and Critical Impact Workers is locally driven and based on the needs of Yukon employers.
When eligible Yukon employers cannot find Canadian citizens or permanent residents to fill permanent full-time jobs, they can find workers from outside of Canada. We select internationally trained and experienced foreign workers who have the skills needed in the local labour market, and nominate them to receive Canadian permanent resident visas to settle and work in Yukon.
If you need help recruiting staff, visit our Employers page to learn about supports available to help you recruit or train people who are already in Yukon. 
These are our Yukon Nominee programs:
The Skilled Worker Program   is for qualified workers who fit into National Occupational Classification (NOC) 0, A or B categories. 
Express Entry is for skilled workers who fit into National Occupational Classification (NOC) A, 0 and B. 
The Critical Impact Worker Program   is for qualified workers who fit into National Occupational Classification (NOC) C or D categories. 
The Business Nominee Program is for individuals with proven business skills who want to own and operate businesses in Yukon.

Keep your work permit valid
You must have a valid work permit and valid temporary resident status to remain eligible for the YNP. It is extremely important that you do not let your work permit and temporary resident status expire while you wait for your YNP application to be assessed. You are responsible for maintaining your status to work in Canada. The processes to renew your work permit and temporary resident status are separate from your YNP application.

IRCC process
After Yukon Nominee Program processing, applicants and any accompanying family members must satisfy IRCC's medical, security, criminal and visa requirements in order to work and live in Canada.
The IRCC process is separate from the Yukon Nominee Program process and will take additional time to complete.
