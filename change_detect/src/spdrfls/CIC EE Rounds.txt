Express Entry invitation rounds
 If you are eligible for Express Entry we will add you to our pool of candidates for immigration to Canada.
We rank candidates in the pool using a points-based system called the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). We regularly select the highest-ranking candidates from the pool and invite them to apply for permanent resident status.
Getting into the Express Entry pool doesnât mean that you will be invited to apply for permanent residence. If you are invited to apply you still have to meet all eligibility and admissibility requirements under Canadaâs immigration law (the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act).
Each invitation round has a set of instructions that are:
posted online at the time of the invitation round
used by the Express Entry system to invite candidates from the pool
The instructions include:
the date and time of the invitation round 
the number of candidates that will get an invitation to apply (ITA)
    
which immigration program(s) are included in the round (if it applies â some invitation rounds may only invite candidates for one program, for instance Federal Skilled Trades only)
if the instructions donât specify an immigration program, that means the invitations are based on CRS scores, no matter which program criteria were met
