Express Entry Skilled Worker
The Express Entry Skilled Worker Category is a path to permanent residence for those intending to reside permanently in Newfoundland and Labrador. Applicants must be accepted into Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canadaâs Express Entry pool, have a job offer in Newfoundland and Labrador, and intend to reside permanently in this province. Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has committed to processing 80 per cent of all Express Entry candidates within six months of receiving the application.
For an in-depth explanation of the Newfoundland and Labrador Express Entry Skilled Worker category, please download the Express Entry Skilled Worker Application Guide    (534 KB).
UPDATE: Effective July 20, 2017, candidates are no longer required to demonstrate proof of settlement funds in the amounts outlined in Section 8.10 of the Express Entry Skilled Worker Guide (p.16). However, 
the Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism strongly advises all applicants to maintain some settlement funds in personal banking accounts prior to their application, as all applicants are required to prove that they can economically establish in the province.

Savings must be maintained for at least three months prior to submitting a PNP application.
The financial account(s) must be in the principal applicant or spouseâs name(s) only;

Your Immigration Program Development Officer may request additional financial documents during the application process.
