Self-employment and work experience gained while you were a full-time student (such as on a co-op work term) doesnât count under this program.
Note: The province of Quebec does not use Express Entry. They select their own skilled workers. See Quebec-selected skilled workers to find out more.
Skilled work experience
To be eligible for the CEC, you need to have Canadian skilled work experience within three years of applying. According to the  Canadian National Occupational Classification (NOC), skilled work experience means:
Managerial jobs (NOC skill level 0)
Professional jobs (NOC skill type A)
Technical jobs and skilled trades (NOC skill type B)
Your experience must be at least
12 months of full-time work
  
30 hours/week for 12 months = 1 year full time (1,560 hours), OR
  
equal amount in part-time hours, such as:
15 hours/week for 24 months = 1 year full time (1,560 hours)
  
30 hours/week for 12 months at more than one job = 1 year full time (1,560 hours)
You must show that you did the duties set out in the occupational description in the NOC. This includes all the main duties listed.
If you donât show that your experience meets the description in the NOC, we will not accept your application.
Education
There is no education requirement for Canadian Experience Class. But you can earn points for your education under Express Entry, if:
you went to school in Canada, and have a certificate, diploma or degree from a Canadian:
    
secondary (high school) or 
post-secondary school
you have foreign education, and you have an Educational  Credential Assessment (ECA) report from an approved agency showing that  your foreign education is equal to a completed certificate, diploma or  degreeÂ  from a Canadian: 
        
secondary  (high school) or 
post-secondary  school

        You'll only benefit from getting an ECA if your  foreign education is equal to a completed Canadian high school diploma or  greater.

Principal applicant

  The person who is invited to apply and submits an  application is the “principal applicant.”
  If you're married or live with a common-law  foreign national partner in Canada, and that person also meets the  requirements, either or both of you can fill out an Express Entry profile.

  A common-law  partner is a person who has lived with you in a marriage-like  relationship for at least one year. Common-law partner refers to both  opposite-sex and same-sex couples.
