Ontario's Express Entry French-Speaking Skilled Worker Stream
Ontarioâs Express Entry French-Speaking Skilled Worker Stream is for French-speaking skilled workers who have strong English language abilities and who want to live and work permanently in Ontario. 
This stream enables the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) to nominate individuals that have qualified for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canadaâs (IRCC) Express Entry pool and who have the required education, skilled work experience, language ability, and other characteristics to help them successfully establish and integrate into Ontarioâs labour market and communities.
 
Please see the French-Speaking Skilled Worker Stream Application Guide for more details.
