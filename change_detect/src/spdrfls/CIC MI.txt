Ministerial Instructions
The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) of 2002 provides the legislative authority for Canadaâs immigration program. IRPA contains various provisions that allow the Minister to issue special Instructions to immigration officers to enable the Government of Canada to best attain its immigration goals. Ministerial Instructions (MIs) are typically issued for limited periods of time, and can touch on a diverse range of issues, from temporary resident processing to federal skilled worker selection and application intake measures.
Ministerial Instructions for the Express Entry Application Management System
The Express Entry application management system will be primarily governed using Ministerial Instructions. These instructions are authorized by s.10.3(1) of the IRPA, which includes provisions that authorize the Minister to issue instructions to manage most features of the Express Entry system.
Express Entry Ministerial Instructions include:
The economic immigration programs included in Express Entry and associated eligibility criteria;
The electronic submission process a candidate must complete in order to submit an Express Entry profile, and any associated exemptions;
How candidates will be ranked in the Express Entry pool;
Information on invitation-to-apply draws;
Time limits for the maximum amount of time a candidate can be in the Express Entry pool, and if invited, how long they have to submit an application for permanent residence;
Candidate information that can be shared with third parties including other government departments; and,
How candidates will be notified about any matter relating to their expression of interest.
As required by IRPA, subsection 10.3(4), all Ministerial Instructions related to Express Entry must be published on CICâs website. Some Ministerial Instructions must also be posted in the Canada Gazette.
These Ministerial Instructions will come into force on January 1, 2015. The entire package of Ministerial Instructions has been posted in the Canada Gazette and on CICâs website.

Ministerial Instructions 7 (MI7): Start-Up Visa Program
Issued on March 30, 2013, CICâs seventh set of Ministerial Instructions (MI7) introduced the Start-Up Visa Program. The Start-Up Visa Program is a pilot program under the Economic Immigration Class which provides entrepreneurs with permanent residency and access to a wide range of business partners. Applicants for the start-up visa require a commitment from a designated Canadian angel investor group, venture capital fund or business incubator to support their business idea before applying to CIC for permanent residence.
 The Start-Up Visa Program is the first to be created under section 14.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which allows the Minister to issue instructions to create economic immigration programs that are limited to a duration of five years. 
 If the program proves successful during the five-year trial period and the Department wishes to maintain it, CIC will formally introduce the new economic class in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.

Ministerial Instructions 14 (MI14): Caregiver Program
Issued on November 29, 2014, CICâs fourteenth set of Ministerial Instructions (MI14) limit permanent residence applications through the Live-in Caregiver Program to foreign nationals whose initial entry to Canada was supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment received by Service Canada on or before November 30, 2014. At the same time, MI14 established two new pathways to permanent residence for foreign nationals with Canadian work experience in caregiving occupations.
The Caring for Children Pathway and Caring for People with High Medical Needs Pathway have similar criteria as the Live-in Caregiver Program, but without the live-in requirement. In addition, the Caring for People with High Medical Needs Pathway identifies several specific health-care occupations that caregivers may gain experience in to qualify for permanent residence.
These new pathways were created under section 14.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which allows the Minister to issue instructions to create economic immigration programs that are limited to a duration of five years.

Ministerial Instructions 16 (MI16): Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Class
Issued on January 23, 2015, CICâs sixteenth set of Ministerial Instructions (MI16) introduced the Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Class.
These Instructions are intended to support a broader strategy for business immigration reform by stimulating innovation and growth in the Canadian economy through the provision of at-risk capital from investors that can be actively invested in Canadian start-ups with high growth potential. They are also intended to attract immigrant investors who will be well prepared to integrate into the Canadian business landscape and society.
This new program was created under section 14.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which allows the Minister to issue instructions to create economic immigration programs that are limited to a duration of five years. 
Read the full text of MI16.
Ministerial Instructions 23 (MI23): Atlantic Immigration Pilot
Effective March 6, 2017, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship’s (IRCC) twenty third set of Ministerial Instructions (MI23) introduced the Atlantic Immigration Pilot. The Atlantic Immigration Pilot consists of three programs designed to provide workers with permanent residency and facilitate their integration into the region with employer support. Eligible skilled immigrants and international graduate students with a job offer from a designated employer in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland and Labrador and an endorsement from the province, can apply for permanent residence. The Pilot will run for three years until December 31, 2019.
The Atlantic Immigration Pilot is created under section 14.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which allows the Minister to issue instructions to create economic immigration programs that are limited to a duration of five years.
