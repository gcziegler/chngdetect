How do I obtain a Work Permit Support Letter from the MPNP to apply for a Work Permit?
Posted on March 22, 2017  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Work Permit Support Letters
If you are a provincial nominee, the MPNP may issue you a Work Permit Support Letter (WPSL) that will allow you to apply to IRCC for a work permit. If you are already working in Manitoba with a temporary work permit and need to renew your work permit, request a WPSL at least two months before your current work permit expires.  If you have obtained a new job offer from a Manitoba employer, you may also request a WPSL to apply for a work permit.
Please make a written request for a WPSL by email to Immigratemanitoba@gov.mb.ca or in-person at the 7th floor, 213 Notre Dame Avenue in Winnipeg.  With your written request, include a copy of your job offer letter from your Manitoba employer.  The letter must be on company letterhead and include your job title, job duties, salary / wage information, start date and contact information for the signatory of the letter.
The issuance of a work permit support letter is at the sole discretion of the MPNP. The MPNP may not issue a work permit support letter if the MPNP is not satisfied with the bona fides of the employer, the employment conditions, or your ability to economically establish in Manitoba.  Your employer must be incorporated or registered by or under an act of the legislature of a province or the Parliament of Canada and operating as a business that has an established production capability, plant or place of business in Manitoba. Your employer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the MPNP that they are an established business with an ability to offer you full-time and long-term employment in Manitoba. If you are not issued a work permit support letter and seek other work permit options, please see the website of Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada.
Note: Your employer must register on the Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Employer Portal and pay the compliance fee before you are issued your work permit support letter.  They should do this at the same time you apply to the MPNP if your work permit is valid for six months or less.
Manitoba Employment Standards
Neither a recruiter nor an employer can ever charge or collect a fee (directly or indirectly) from you for your job in Manitoba.
Manitoba Employment Standards administers laws on minimum wages, hours of work, holidays and other workplace entitlements and responsibilities. The program enforces The Employment Standards Code, The Construction Industry Wages Act, The Remembrance Day Act, The Worker Recruitment and Protection Act and The Retail Businesses Holiday Closing Act. It also investigates complaints about violations of these laws.
If you have any questions or concerns about the terms of your employment, contact Employment Standards for further information.

If I have dependants, relatives, or friends living somewhere else in Canada, will that cause my application to be automatically refused?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
In the Declaration of Intent submitted as part of the application, you declare that you understand that Manitoba only nominates individuals who intend to reside in Manitoba along with your dependent family members. The MPNP strongly encourages you to demonstrate to the MPNP that you will meet this requirement whether you have or do not have relatives, dependants, or friends in another province. If, for example, a dependant is studying in another province, you might consider moving this dependant to an educational facility in Manitoba to demonstrate a commitment to the province. Having friends or relatives in another province does not automatically cause an application to be refused. However, the MPNP must be convinced that the applicant will not come to Canada and reside in the province where those friends or relatives currently are. It is up to you to convince the MPNP of your sincerity to relocate to Manitoba.

What is the Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative within the MPNP-B?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program for Business (MPNP-B) is a component of an immigration program that was created through an agreement between the Government of Canada and the Province of Manitoba. The Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative (FSRI) is a special rural economic initiative under the auspices of the MPNP-B. The purpose of this program is to attract suitable farm business persons that meet the criteria of the FSRI. The MPNP-B accelerates the immigration process by providing a Nomination Certificate to allow for faster processing by the Government of Canada of your immigration application.

How much does the MPNP-B require me to invest in Manitoba in the FSRI Program?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
The amount of investment you make in Manitoba will be dictated by the type of farm business you establish, the size of the operation, and the farm sector that you intend to enter. Depending on the size of the farm the investment may be in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. While the total investment may include financing, a minimum of $150,000 must be from your personal resources. The CDN$75,000 deposit is not part of the investment.

Must I make a Farm Business Research Visit to Manitoba before submitting my FSRI application?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Yes. Farm Business Research Visits are mandatory for a minimum of five business days. This visit will allow you to identify and assess potential farming opportunities as well as experience rural Manitoba’s quality of life.

If I attend a Farm Business Research Visit and submit my application to the FSRI, and if I am interviewed, will I automatically be nominated by Manitoba?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Making a Farm Business Research Visit to Manitoba and being interviewed will not guarantee that you will receive a Nomination Certificate. The MPNP-B bases its decision on many factors in addition to the minimum net worth and experience criteria.

Why do the FSRI eligibility criteria specify that an applicant must demonstrate practical farming skills, technological knowledge and experience in technological-based farming practice that will immediately transfer directly to Manitoba’s current primary production industry?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
In the past, applicants who successfully established rural farm businesses consistent with existing Manitoba farm operations and investment levels displayed the characteristics of having farming skills, technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices, and language skills that were immediately adaptable or transferable to Manitoba. The technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices were being employed by the successful applicant in their existing farm business.
Applicants with farming as their business intention who previously did not employ similar technological based farming practices on their farm operation, or have suitable language skills were less likely to be successful in establishing a farm business in rural Manitoba.

I have never owned a farm business or managed a farming operation. Does this affect my chances of qualifying?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Yes. All FSRI applicants must be able to demonstrate that they have a minimum of three years of farm business management or farm ownership and operation experience supported by verifiable documents. You must demonstrate your adaptability, specifically your practical farming skills, technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices which will transfer directly to Manitoba’s primary farm production industry that is currently in practice.

I operate a farm where the farm technologies, production practices, amount of investment, climate and / or government requirements are considerably different than Manitoba, but I am a hard worker, produce similar crops such as wheat and cattle, and I adapt easily to new business situations. Do I have a reasonable chance of being approved under the FSRI?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Manitoba will only nominate suitable farm business applicants whose practical farming skills, technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices are immediately transferable to rural Manitoba, and that a long term contribution to the Manitoba economy can be achieved through their nomination. The MPNP-B recognizes that the FSRI Program will not be a suitable program for all potential farm business applicants. Applicants who do not meet the eligibility criteria of the FSRI are encouraged to review the MPNP-B Business Program, the MPNP Skilled Worker Program, or immigration programs offered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada with Manitoba as their destination.
