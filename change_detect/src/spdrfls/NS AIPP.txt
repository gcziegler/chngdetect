Atlantic Immigration Pilot
The Atlantic Immigration Pilot is a creative approach to addressing our labour market challenges.
Starting in March 2017, employers in Nova Scotia will be able to use the Pilot to hire foreign workers.
To learn more about the Pilot, please contact our Employer Support Team. We’re here to help.
Eligibility
Employers looking to fill labour gaps through the Pilot must first be approved for eligibility by being designated and then have their positions endorsed by the Province.
Once the employer’s positions are endorsed, candidate(s) identified by the employer can apply for permanent residency directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.
The foreign worker can also access temporary pathways (i.e., obtain a work permit) while waiting for permanent residency.
To become designated, an employer must:
Have a business operating in good standing
Provide information on labour needs
Commit to working with a service provider organization on settlement and retention
To become endorsed, an employer must:
Demonstrate efforts to hire locally have not been successful
Recruit a foreign worker
Provide a valid, full-time, non-seasonal job offer co-signed with the foreign worker
Provide an individualized settlement plan co-signed with the foreign worker
