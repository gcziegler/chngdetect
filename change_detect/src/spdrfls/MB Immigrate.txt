Immigrate to Manitoba
In our high-powered economy, skilled workers, tradespeople and professionals are in demand. In fact, the Government of Manitoba projects a labour shortage of over 20,000 skilled workers by 2020.
That’s why Manitoba was the first Canadian province to establish its own immigration program, the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP).
Each year, some 15,000 immigrants arrive in Manitoba. The outcomes for internationally experienced workers who immigrate through the MPNP are positive. According to a recent survey, 85 per cent of Manitoba nominees were working three months after arrival, 76 per cent were homeowners within five years and 95 per cent of families settled permanently in the community.
Whether you simply want to visit Manitoba to explore our rich cultural history and natural beauty, come to Manitoba to work temporarily or immigrate to our province through one of the available options, including the world-renowned Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program, in this section you will find everything you need to know to be successful.
The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) seeks skilled workers, businesspeople and their families with the intention and ability to successfully settle and economically establish in Manitoba as permanent residents. Manitoba makes it easy to immigrate and settle in our province.
The MPNP for Skilled Workers is locally driven and based on the needs of Manitoba employers. We select internationally trained and experienced workers who have the skills needed in the local labour market, and nominate them to receive Canadian permanent resident visas to settle and work in Manitoba. There are two streams:
Skilled Workers in Manitoba
Skilled Workers Overseas
The MPNP for Business allows Manitoba to recruit and nominate qualified business people from around the world who have the intent and ability to move to Manitoba and establish, purchase a business or become partners in an existing business. There are two streams:

Who cannot apply to the MPNP?
The following are not eligible to submit an application to the MPNP:
Refugee claimants, or individuals involved in a federal appeal or removal process
Live-in Caregivers currently living in Canada
Temporary foreign workers currently working and residing in a province other than Manitoba
Spouses of Canadian citizens or permanent residents
Individuals who have been refused by the MPNP within the last six months and who are not able to address the reason(s) for refusal
Individuals who have an active immigration application with any other provincial immigration program in Canada
Note
Other restrictions on eligibility may also apply for each MPNP stream. Please see the designated MPNP stream pages for more information on the requirements of each category. While all occupations are eligible for assessment, the MPNP reserves the right to refuse applications in certain occupations based on clear and well-documented issues of over-supply and lack of labour market opportunities. The MPNP reserves the right to require applicants who, in the view of the Program, have the intention to immigrate to Canada for business purposes, to apply through the MPNP for Business only.
