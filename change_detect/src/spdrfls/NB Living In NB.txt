Welcome to New Brunswick  
 
Located on Canada’s east coast along the Atlantic Ocean, New Brunswick offers a distinct way of life and exciting career opportunities. We value the experiences and skills of newcomers. The New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program (NBPNP) helps immigrants come to New Brunswick more quickly.
The NBPNP is a provincial economic immigration made possible through an agreement with the Government of Canada.  The NBPNP selects and nominates qualified skilled workers from around the world who will live in New Brunswick and contribute to the local economy.
The NBPNP is currently only recruiting individuals with specific skill sets directly sought by NB employers. Those individuals who have received interest from NB employers will be screened for NBPNP immigration programs streams, including the Express Entry Labour Market stream.  All NBPNP streams are detailed at: www.gnb.ca/immigration.
 
Please NOTE: Due to a high volume of calls, we will not answer any telephone inquiries regarding upcoming information sessions! All inquiries will be answered by email ONLY! We appreciate your understanding.  Email us at: [email protected]   ( do not send unsolicited esumes or request for HELP to immigrate to Canada-- check the registration pages to see what skills we are looking for and only then register or send resumes )
 We have received a large number of unsolicited resumes and emails. Please note that all emails and resumes will be deleted immediatelly and the senders will be blocked from accessing the site if they do not correspond to the positions we have listed on the registration pages.
