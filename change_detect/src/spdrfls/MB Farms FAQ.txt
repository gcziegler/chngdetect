What is the Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative within the MPNP-B?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program for Business (MPNP-B) is a component of an immigration program that was created through an agreement between the Government of Canada and the Province of Manitoba. The Farm Strategic Recruitment Initiative (FSRI) is a special rural economic initiative under the auspices of the MPNP-B. The purpose of this program is to attract suitable farm business persons that meet the criteria of the FSRI. The MPNP-B accelerates the immigration process by providing a Nomination Certificate to allow for faster processing by the Government of Canada of your immigration application.

How much does the MPNP-B require me to invest in Manitoba in the FSRI Program?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
The amount of investment you make in Manitoba will be dictated by the type of farm business you establish, the size of the operation, and the farm sector that you intend to enter. Depending on the size of the farm the investment may be in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. While the total investment may include financing, a minimum of $150,000 must be from your personal resources. The CDN$75,000 deposit is not part of the investment.

Must I make a Farm Business Research Visit to Manitoba before submitting my FSRI application?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Yes. Farm Business Research Visits are mandatory for a minimum of five business days. This visit will allow you to identify and assess potential farming opportunities as well as experience rural Manitoba’s quality of life.

If I attend a Farm Business Research Visit and submit my application to the FSRI, and if I am interviewed, will I automatically be nominated by Manitoba?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Making a Farm Business Research Visit to Manitoba and being interviewed will not guarantee that you will receive a Nomination Certificate. The MPNP-B bases its decision on many factors in addition to the minimum net worth and experience criteria.

Why do the FSRI eligibility criteria specify that an applicant must demonstrate practical farming skills, technological knowledge and experience in technological-based farming practice that will immediately transfer directly to Manitoba’s current primary production industry?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
In the past, applicants who successfully established rural farm businesses consistent with existing Manitoba farm operations and investment levels displayed the characteristics of having farming skills, technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices, and language skills that were immediately adaptable or transferable to Manitoba. The technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices were being employed by the successful applicant in their existing farm business.
Applicants with farming as their business intention who previously did not employ similar technological based farming practices on their farm operation, or have suitable language skills were less likely to be successful in establishing a farm business in rural Manitoba.

I have never owned a farm business or managed a farming operation. Does this affect my chances of qualifying?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Yes. All FSRI applicants must be able to demonstrate that they have a minimum of three years of farm business management or farm ownership and operation experience supported by verifiable documents. You must demonstrate your adaptability, specifically your practical farming skills, technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices which will transfer directly to Manitoba’s primary farm production industry that is currently in practice.

I operate a farm where the farm technologies, production practices, amount of investment, climate and / or government requirements are considerably different than Manitoba, but I am a hard worker, produce similar crops such as wheat and cattle, and I adapt easily to new business situations. Do I have a reasonable chance of being approved under the FSRI?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Manitoba will only nominate suitable farm business applicants whose practical farming skills, technical knowledge and experience in technological based farming practices are immediately transferable to rural Manitoba, and that a long term contribution to the Manitoba economy can be achieved through their nomination. The MPNP-B recognizes that the FSRI Program will not be a suitable program for all potential farm business applicants. Applicants who do not meet the eligibility criteria of the FSRI are encouraged to review the MPNP-B Business Program, the MPNP Skilled Worker Program, or immigration programs offered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada with Manitoba as their destination.

I am not required to file income tax assessments or income tax returns on income that was earned through farming. Will this affect my chance of being a successful FSRI applicant?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
All FSRI applicants must be able to demonstrate that they have a minimum of three years of farm business management or farm ownership and operation experience supported by verifiable documents. The MPNP-B requires all applicants to document their accumulation of funds as per IMM0008 Schedule 4a. Without official government documents to support declared income from farming operations as requested in the Document Checklist, the MPNP-B may not be able to accurately assess that you will meet the Program’s and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s source of funds requirements.

I do not understand English or French. Will this affect my chances of being approved under the FSRI?
Posted on August 26, 2016  by  Manitoba Immigration 
Though not cause for automatic refusal of an application, the inability to speak English or French will negatively impact your chances of being approved under the FSRI. Although the FSRI does not employ an adaptability matrix that awards points for English or French language capabilities, the FSRI recognizes that language capabilities in either of Canada’s two official languages are an important adaptability skill which can accelerate your ability to become economically established in rural Manitoba. FSRI applicants must demonstrate suitability and adaptability to the Manitoba farm industry, which is rural based and services are offered predominantly in English or French.
