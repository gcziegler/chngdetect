About Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP)
Ontario recognizes that employers play a critical role in our economic success. For many employers, newcomers to Ontario are a valuable source of skilled labour. If you are an Ontario employer having difficulty finding the workers you need, Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program may be the program for you.
What is it?
The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) is an economic immigration program designed to help Ontario meet its labour market and economic development priorities. The program allows Ontario to nominate, for permanent residence, individuals who have the skills and experience to contribute to Ontarioâs economy, and assists employers in recruiting and retaining foreign workers.
The OINP is operated by the province of Ontario in partnership with the federal government through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). The OINP assesses applications and nominates candidates for permanent residence. Individuals nominated by the OINP can then apply for permanent residence through IRCC, IRCC makes the final decision on each application and issues permanent resident visas to successful applicants.

Nominated individuals must then apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). IRCC then performs important admissibility checks for health and security in order to grant permanent residence to applicants. Nominees can also apply to IRCC for a temporary work permit while their permanent residence application is being processed.
Applying for immigration can seem complicated when both the Provincial and Federal Governments play a role in the process.
