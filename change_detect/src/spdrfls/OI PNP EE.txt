About Ontario Express Entry
Express Entry is a new application management system introduced by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to manage permanent resident applications for skilled migration to Canada. To qualify for Express Entry and be considered for nomination by Ontario, candidates must qualify for one of two federal immigration programs:
Federal Skilled Worker Program
Canadian Experience Class
Ontario Express Entry
Ontario has created two new streams for skilled workers who want to live and work permanently in Ontario. The two new streams draw from the Federal Express Entry selection system.
Ontario Express Entry: Human Capital Priorities Stream
Ontario Express Entry: French-Speaking Skilled Worker Stream
Ontario Express Entry: Skilled Trades Stream
This enables Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) to nominate individuals that have qualified for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canadaâs Express Entry pool and who have the required education, skilled work experience, language ability, and other factors to help them successfully establish and integrate into Ontarioâs labour market and communities.
