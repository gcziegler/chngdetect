New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program (NBPNP)
NBPNP is a provincial immigration program made possible through an agreement with the Government of Canada. As an economic program, the NBPNP selects, and nominates, qualified business people and skilled workers from around the world who will live in New Brunswick and contribute to the local economy. 
Like many other Canadian provinces and territories, New Brunswick has its own immigration program streams, targeting certain groups, and eligibility criteria. Some streams target entrepreneurs, graduates, skilled workers with employer support, skilled workers with family support, etc. Eligibility criteria vary and can be found in  Program guides along with application forms.
The Express Entry New Brunswick Labour Market Stream is new to the NBPNP. Potential applicants are asked to complete an expression of interest and submit it to the NBPNP. Details are provided on the NBPNP Express Entry page. To find more answers to your questions, please consult our FAQs. 
We are accepting EOIs from potential applicants who demonstrate French as a first language, proven by a Test dâÃ©valuation de francais (TEF).  
Please note that New Brunswick is only accepting Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for the PNP Express Entry Labour Market Stream from individuals currently employed in New Brunswick.

Please continue to monitor this page for any updates.
 
Immigration Program Officers review applications based on eligibility requirements and selection factors. You must meet eligibility requirements. You should also be aware that meeting the eligibility requirements does not guarantee nomination. Priority will be given to applicants who have the greatest potential to become economically established in New Brunswick. To determine if you meet the requirements of the Program, carefully review the information in the relevant Program Guide located on the right hand side box of this page, before submitting your application.
