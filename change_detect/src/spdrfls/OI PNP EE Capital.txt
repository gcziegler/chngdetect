Ontario's Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream
Notice: Deadline for Submitting Online Applications through the OINP e-Filing Portal
In order to be responsive to unprecedented application-volume demand on the system, the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) has revised the deadline from seven to 14 calendar days to submit applications through the e-Filing Portal for the following streams:
International Masters Graduate Stream
International PhD Graduate Stream
Ontarioâs Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream
Once you successfully register a profile under any of the above streams through the OINP e Filing Portal, you now have 14 calendar days to complete your application. âWe are making every effort to ensure we have the technical capacity to meet volume demands and we will continue to monitor the system 24 hours a day, to address any issues.
Ontarioâs Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream is designed for skilled workers who want to live and work permanently in Ontario.
This stream enables the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) to nominate individuals that have qualified for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canadaâs (IRCC) Express Entry pool and who have the required education, skilled work experience, language ability, and other characteristics to help them successfully establish and integrate into Ontarioâs labour market and communities.
Please see the Application Guide: Human Capital Priorities Stream for more details.
