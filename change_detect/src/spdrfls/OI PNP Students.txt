What is the International Student with a Job Offer Stream?
Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) offers international students with a job offer the opportunity to permanently live and work in Ontario.
Prospective nominees (the applicant) can only apply if they have received an approved permanent full-time job offer from an Ontario employer, or from a business making an approved and endorsed investment in Ontario.
Important: Before Applying as a Nominee
In order to apply as a nominee, the applicant must have a job offer that has been approved by OINP. To do this:
Ontario employers must first submit a Pre-Screen Application to have the position they wish to fill approved by OINP. For information on the Pre-Screen application process for Ontario employers, visit the Employer section of the OINP website.
Companies making an investment in Ontario under the Investment Component of OINP must first have their investment approved and endorsed by an Ontario ministry. They can then submit a Pre-Screen Application. For more information, visit the Investor section of the OINP website.
The application fee for international students with a job offer is $1500.
This fee can be paid by either the applicant or the employer, but must be included in the nominee application package.
OINP no longer accepts incomplete nominee applications, and will return them to applicants. In cases where OINP returns incomplete applications to applicants, OINP will also return the enclosed application fees.
Applicants submitting applications in person must note that reception staff are not authorized to provide application advice or review the completeness of applications.

Authorizing a representative
Applicants are not obliged to hire a representative.
However, if the applicant receives help from an individual in applying for OINP and the applicant wishes to authorize this individual to act on their behalf with OINP, the applicant must submit the Authorizing or Cancelling a Representative Form with their application.
An applicant may only have one representative at a time, and this representative may only be appointed through the Authorizing or Cancelling an Employer Representative Form. If a new representative is appointed, the previous representative will no longer be authorized to conduct business on behalf of the applicant, or receive information about the application.
Paid Authorized Representatives are defined by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of Canada (IRPA). Paid Authorized Representatives are: 
immigration consultants who are members in good standing of the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (ICCRC),
lawyers who are members in good standing of a Canadian provincial or territorial law society, along with students-at-law under their supervision, and
Notaries who are members in good standing of the Chambre des notaires du Quebec.
If an applicant authorizes a paid representative who does not qualify as a paid Authorized Representative, the applicant will be contacted by OINP and advised that the individual must be removed or replaced as the representative. If the applicant designates a new authorized representative, any communications will be forwarded to the new representative. Otherwise, processing of the applicantâs file will continue without representation.
If an applicant authorizes a paid representative who does not qualify as a paid Authorized Representative, the applicant will be contacted by OINP and advised that the individual must be removed or replaced as the representative. Otherwise the application will be denied.
See Section 3.2 of the Application Guide for International Students with a Job Offer for more information on completing the Authorizing or Cancelling a Representative Form.
