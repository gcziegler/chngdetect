To apply for the parent and grandparent super visa, you must:
be the parent or grandparent of a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada,
be allowed to enter Canada and
meet certain other conditions.
Note: You cannot include dependants in this application.
Immigration officers consider several things before they decide if you can come to Canada. You must be a real visitor to Canada who will leave by choice at the end of your visit. An officer will look at these things when you apply:
your ties to your home country,
the purpose of your visit,
your family and finances,
the overall economic and political stability of your home country, and
an invitation from a Canadian host.
You must also:
prove that your child or grandchild in Canada meets a minimum income threshold,
provide a written statement from that child or grandchild that he or she will give you financial support,
have valid Canadian medical insurance coverage for at least one year and
have an immigration medical exam.
