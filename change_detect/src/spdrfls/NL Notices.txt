Citizenship and Immigration Canada will launch âExpress Entry,â its new system for managing permanent resident applications on January 1, 2015.
The Express Entry system will move Canadaâs economic immigration system from a first-come-first-served model to an invitation-to-apply model. Express Entry candidates will be invited to apply for permanent residence under certain economic immigration programs based on how well their qualifications align with integration success factors identified by Citizenship and Immigration Canada. These success factors include, for example, a job offer, a provincial nomination, language ability, experience and education.
The new system will help skilled foreign workers become permanent residents more quickly due to faster processing times and will provide employers with a new avenue for recruiting foreign workers.

Details regarding the new NL Express Entry Skilled Worker category and eligibility criteria will be posted to this web page in the coming weeks.
