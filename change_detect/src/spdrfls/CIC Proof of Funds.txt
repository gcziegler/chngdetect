Eligibility

You canât borrow this money from another person. You must be able to use this money to pay the costs of living for your family (even if they arenât coming with you).
If your spouse is coming with you, you can count money you have together in a joint account. You may be able to count money in an account under their  name only, but you must prove you have access to the money.
If you are invited to apply, you must give written proof that you have this money.
You donât need to show that you have enough money to support yourself and your family to meet the program requirements of the Canadian Experience Class (this includes provincial nominees who are part of the CEC stream).
Note that you do not need proof of funds if you are currently:
authorized to work in Canada and
have a valid job offer
Keep your funds up-to-date in your profile. The system may find that you are eligible for more than one program. You donât always know ahead of time which program you will be invited under.
How much money you will need
The amount of money you need to support your family is set by the size of your family. To calculate the size of your family you must include:
yourself
your spouse or partner
your dependent children and
your spouseâs dependent children
This includes your spouse or dependent children who are permanent residents or Canadian citizens.

What we accept as proof
Funds must be readily available to you. For example, you can't use equity on real property as proof of settlement funds.
The funds must be available both when you apply and when (if) we issue you a permanent resident visa. You must prove to an immigration officer that you can legally access them to use to settle here when you arrive.
For proof, you must get official letters from any banks or financial institutions where you are keeping money.
Letter(s) must:
be printed on the financial institutionâs letterhead
include their contact information (address, telephone number and email address)

account numbers
the date each account was opened
the current balance of each account
the average balance for the past six months
Updates to fund requirements
We update the proof of funds numbers every year based on 50 per cent of the low income cut-off totals. The changes are small but there is a chance it could affect your eligibility. Be sure to check the new numbers to your own once theyâre posted.
How much money you should bring
Research how much it costs to live in the place where you plan to settle in Canada.
Bring as much money as you can to make moving and finding a home in Canada easier. Canadian customs regulations require you to declare if you're bringing more than CAN$10,000 into Canada. If you don't tell them, you may be fined, and your funds could be seized. This includes:
cash
documents that show property or capital payable to you, such as:
      
stocks
bonds
debentures
treasury bills
documents that guarantee payment of a set amount of money, which are payable to you, such as:
      
banker's drafts
cheques
travellersâ cheques
money orders).
